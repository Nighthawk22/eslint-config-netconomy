# Changes

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. The version number
is based on [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) with the major version
being a combination of ESLints major version number and package internal
breaking releases. Following this schema, "300" is the first release targeted at
ESLint 3.x.x, "301" will be first breaking release still targeting ESLint
3.x.x. Internal major releases will probably mostly contain new rules set up as
errors which were previously only warnings or less.


## 300.0.0 (unreleased)

Welcome to the initial release. As the number indicates, this one is targeted at
ESLint 3.x.x.
